<h1 style="text-align:center">TS - Decorators</h1>

With the introduction of Classes in TypeScript and ES6, there now exist certain scenarios that require additional features to support annotating or modifying classes and class members. Decorators provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members. Decorators are a [stage 2 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) for JavaScript and are available as an experimental feature of TypeScript.

> [!NOTE]
> Decorators are an experimental feature that may change in future releases.

To enable experimental support for decorators, you must enable the *experimentalDecorators* compiler option either on the command line or in your `tsconfig.json`:

**Command Line:**
```command
tsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators
```

**tsconfig.json:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES5",
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

## Decorators
A Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter. Decorators use the form `@expression`, where `expression` must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.

For example, given the decorator `@sealed` we might write the `sealed` function as follows:
```js
function sealed(target) {
  // do something with 'target' ...
}
```

## Decorator Factories
If we want to customize how a decorator is applied to a declaration, we can write a decorator factory. A Decorator Factory is simply a function that returns the expression that will be called by the decorator at runtime.

We can write a decorator factory in the following fashion:
```js
function color(value: string) {
  // this is the decorator factory, it sets up
  // the returned decorator function
  return function (target) {
    // this is the decorator
    // do something with 'target' and 'value'...
  };
}
```

## Class Decorators
A Class Decorator is declared just before a class declaration. The class decorator is applied to the constructor of the class and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a class definition. A class decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as on a `declare` class).

The expression for the class decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the constructor of the decorated class as its only argument.

If the class decorator returns a value, it will replace the class declaration with the provided constructor function.

The following is an example of a class decorator (`@sealed)` applied to a `BugReport` class:
```ts
@sealed
class BugReport {
  type = "report";
  title: string;
 
  constructor(t: string) {
    this.title = t;
  }
}
```
We can define the `@sealed` decorator using the following function declaration:
```ts
function sealed(constructor: Function) {
  Object.seal(constructor);
  Object.seal(constructor.prototype);
}
```

## Method Decorators
A Method Decorator is declared just before a method declaration. The decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the method, and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a method definition. A method decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, on an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the method decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:
1. Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.
2. The name of the member.
3. The Property Descriptor for the member.

The following is an example of a method decorator (`@enumerable`) applied to a method on the `Greeter` class:
```ts
class Greeter {
  greeting: string;
  constructor(message: string) {
    this.greeting = message;
  }
 
  @enumerable(false)
  greet() {
    return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
  }
}
```
We can define the `@enumerable` decorator using the following function declaration:
```ts
function enumerable(value: boolean) {
  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    descriptor.enumerable = value;
  };
}
```
The `@enumerable(false)` decorator here is a decorator factory. When the `@enumerable(false)` decorator is called, it modifies the `enumerable` property of the property descriptor.

## Accessor Decorators
An Accessor Decorator is declared just before an accessor declaration. The accessor decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the accessor and can be used to observe, modify, or replace an accessor’s definitions. An accessor decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the accessor decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:
1. Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.
2. The name of the member.
3. The Property Descriptor for the member.

The following is an example of an accessor decorator (`@configurable`) applied to a member of the `Point` class:
```ts
class Point {
  private _x: number;
  private _y: number;
  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    this._x = x;
    this._y = y;
  }
 
  @configurable(false)
  get x() {
    return this._x;
  }
 
  @configurable(false)
  get y() {
    return this._y;
  }
}
```
We can define the `@configurable` decorator using the following function declaration:
```ts
function configurable(value: boolean) {
  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    descriptor.configurable = value;
  };
}
```

## Property Decorators
A Property Decorator is declared just before a property declaration. A property decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the property decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following two arguments:
1. Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.
2. The name of the member.

We can use this information to record metadata about the property, as in the following example:
```ts
class Greeter {
  @format("Hello, %s")
  greeting: string;

  constructor(message: string) {
    this.greeting = message;
  }

  greet() {
    let formatString = getFormat(this, "greeting");
    return formatString.replace("%s", this.greeting);
  }
}
```
We can then define the `@format` decorator and `getFormat` functions using the following function declarations:
```ts
import "reflect-metadata";

const formatMetadataKey = Symbol("format");

function format(formatString: string) {
  return Reflect.metadata(formatMetadataKey, formatString);
}

function getFormat(target: any, propertyKey: string) {
  return Reflect.getMetadata(formatMetadataKey, target, propertyKey);
}
```

## Parameter Decorators
A Parameter Decorator is declared just before a parameter declaration. The parameter decorator is applied to the function for a class constructor or method declaration. A parameter decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the parameter decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:
1. Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.
2. The name of the member.
3. The ordinal index of the parameter in the function’s parameter list.

The following is an example of a parameter decorator (@required) applied to parameter of a member of the `BugReport` class:
```ts
class BugReport {
  type = "report";
  title: string;
 
  constructor(t: string) {
    this.title = t;
  }
 
  @validate
  print(@required verbose: boolean) {
    if (verbose) {
      return `type: ${this.type}\ntitle: ${this.title}`;
    } else {
     return this.title; 
    }
  }
}
```

## Metadata
Some examples use the `reflect-metadata` library which adds a polyfill for an experimental metadata API. This library is not yet part of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) standard. However, once decorators are officially adopted as part of the ECMAScript standard these extensions will be proposed for adoption.

You can install this library via npm:
```command
npm i reflect-metadata --save
```
TypeScript includes experimental support for emitting certain types of metadata for declarations that have decorators. To enable this experimental support, you must set the emitDecoratorMetadata compiler option either on the command line or in your `tsconfig.json`:
```command
tsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators --emitDecoratorMetadata
```

**tsconfig.json:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES5",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
  }
}
```
