### Var
The var declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable
```js
var varname1 = value;
var varname1 = 0, varname2 = 0;
```

### Let
The let statement declares a block-scoped local variable
```js
let name1 = value;
```
### Const
Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared. !(If const is defined, the defined name cannot be redefined as var or let)
```js
const name1 = value1;
```
