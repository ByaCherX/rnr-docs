### while
The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.
```js
while (condition)
   statement
```

### do...while
The *do...while* creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false. The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once.
```js
do
   statement
while (condition);
```

### for
The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop.
```js
for ( [initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression] )
   statement
```

###  for each...in
-Documents no aviable-

### for...in
The for...in iterates over all enumerable properties of an object that are keyed by strings (ignoring ones keyed by Symbols), including inherited enumerable properties.
```js
for (variable in object)
   statement
```

### for...of
The *for...of* creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object.
```js
for (variable of iterable) {
   statement
}
```

### for await...of
The *for await...of* creates a loop iterating over async iterable objects as well as on sync iterables, including: built-in String, Array, Array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined async/sync iterables. It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object. This statement can only be used inside an async function.
```js
for await (variable of iterable) {
   statement
}
```
