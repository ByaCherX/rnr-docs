# Compiler intrinsics and assembly language 

If a function is an intrinsic, the code for that function is usually inserted inline, avoiding the overhead of a function call and allowing highly efficient machine instructions to be emitted for that function. An intrinsic is often faster than the equivalent inline assembly, because the optimizer has a built-in knowledge of how many intrinsics behave, so some optimizations can be available that are not available when inline assembly is used. Also, the optimizer can expand the intrinsic differently, align buffers differently, or make other adjustments depending on the context and arguments of the call.

The use of intrinsics affects the portability of code, because intrinsics that are available in Visual C++ might not be available if the code is compiled with other compilers and some intrinsics that might be available for some target architectures are not available for all architectures. However, intrinsics are usually more portable than inline assembly. The intrinsics are required on 64-bit architectures where inline assembly is not supported.

Some intrinsics, such as __assume and __ReadWriteBarrier, provide information to the compiler, which affects the behavior of the optimizer.
