<h1 style="text-align:center">SQL Statements / Sequence </h1>

A sequence is an object that generates a sequence of numeric values, as specified by the ``CREATE SEQUENCE`` statement.

``CREATE SEQUENCE`` will create a sequence that generates new values when called with NEXT VALUE FOR sequence_name. It's an alternative to ``AUTO INCREMENT`` when one wants to have more control of how the numbers are generated. As the SEQUENCE caches values (up to the CACHE value in the ``CREATE SEQUENCE`` statement, by default 1000) it can in some cases be much faster than AUTO INCREMENT. Another benefit is that one can access the last value generated by all used sequences, which solves one of the limitations with LAST_INSERT_ID().

### Creating a Sequence
The ``CREATE SEQUENCE`` statement is used to create a sequence. Here is an example of a sequence starting at 100, incrementing by 10 each time:
```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE s START WITH 100 INCREMENT BY 10;
```

The ``CREATE SEQUENCE`` statement, along with defaults, can be viewd with the ``SHOW CREATE SEQUENCE STATEMENT``, for example:
```sql
SHOW CREATE SEQUENCE s\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: s
Create Table: CREATE SEQUENCE `s` start with 100 minvalue 1 maxvalue 9223372036854775806 
  increment by 10 cache 1000 nocycle ENGINE=InnoDB
```
