### < gradient>
The `<gradient>` *CSS data type* is a special type of `<image>` that consists of a progressive transition between two or more colors.

<tx1 class="c1s1">**Linear gradient**</tx1></br>
Linear gradients transition colors progressively along an imaginary line. They are generated with the linear-gradient() function.

<tx1 class="c1s1">**Radial gradient**</tx1></br>
Radial gradients transition colors progressively from a center point (origin). They are generated with the radial-gradient() function.

<tx1 class="c1s1">**Repeating gradient**</tx1></br>
Repeating gradients duplicate a gradient as much as necessary to fill a given area. They are generated with the repeating-linear-gradient() and repeating-radial-gradient() functions.

<tx1 class="c1s1">**Conic gradient**</tx1></br>
Conic gradients transition colors progressively around a circle. They are generated with the conic-gradient() function.

### < image>
The `<image>` CSS data type represents a two-dimensional image.

The `<image>` data type can be represented with any of the following:
* An image denoted by the url() data type
* A `<gradient>` data type
* A part of the webpage, defined by the element() function
* An image, image fragment or solid patch of color, defined by the image() function
* A blending of two or more images defined by the cross-fade() function.
* A selection of images chosen based on resolution defined by the image-set() function.
