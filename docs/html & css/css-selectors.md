### :any-link
The `:any-link` CSS *pseudo-class* selector represents an element that acts as the source anchor of a hyperlink, independent of whether it has been visited. In other words, it matches every `<a>` or `<area>` element that has an `href` attribute. Thus, it matches all elements that match `:link` or `:visited`.

### :autofill
The `:autofill` CSS *pseudo-class* matches when an *`<input>`* element has its value autofilled by the browser. The class stops matching if the user edits the field.

### :checked
The `:checked` CSS *pseudo-class* selector represents any radio (`<input type="radio">`), checkbox (`<input type="checkbox">`), or option (`<option> in a <select>`) element that is checked or toggled to an on state.

### :disabled
The `:disabled` CSS *pseudo-class* represents any disabled element. An element is disabled if it can't be activated (selected, clicked on, typed into, etc.) or accept focus. The element also has an enabled state, in which it can be activated or accept focus.

### :enabled
The `:enabled` CSS *pseudo-class* represents any enabled element. An element is enabled if it can be activated (selected, clicked on, typed into, etc.) or accept focus. The element also has a disabled state, in which it can't be activated or accept focus.

### :first-of-type
The `:first-of-type` CSS *pseudo-class* represents the first element of its type among a group of sibling elements.

### :focus-visible
The `:focus-visible` *pseudo-class* applies while an element matches the *:focus* pseudo-class and the UA (*User Agent*) determines via heuristics that the focus should be made evident on the element. (Many browsers show a “focus ring” by default in this case.)

### :hover 
The `:hover` CSS *pseudo-class* matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).

### :in-range
The `:in-range` CSS pseudo-class represents an `<input>` element whose current value is within the range limits specified by the min and max attributes.

### :invalid
The `:invalid` CSS `*pseudo-class*` represents any `<input>` or other `<form>` element whose contents fail to validate.

### :last-child 
The `:last-child` CSS *pseudo-class* represents the last element among a group of sibling elements.

### :nth-child()
The `:nth-child()` CSS *pseudo-class* matches elements based on their position in a group of siblings.

### :nth-last-of-type()
The `:nth-last-of-type()` CSS `*pseudo-class*` matches elements of a given type, based on their position among a group of siblings, counting from the end.

### :out-of-range
The `:out-of-range` CSS *pseudo-class* represents an `<input>` element whose current value is outside the range limits specified by the *min* and *max* attributes.

### :read-only
The `:read-only` CSS *pseudo-class* represents an element (such as `input` or `textarea`) that is not editable by the user.

### :read-write
The `:read-write` CSS *pseudo-class* represents an element (such as `input` or `textarea`) that is editable by the user.

<h3 style="color: rgb(240,159,29)">:root</h3>
The `:root` CSS *pseudo-class* matches the root element of a tree representing the document. In HTML, `:root` represents the `< html>` element and is identical to the selector `html`, except that its specificity is higher.

### :scope
The `:scope` CSS *pseudo-class* represents elements that are a reference point for selectors to match against.

### :target
The `:target` CSS *pseudo-class* represents a unique element (the target element) with an id matching the URL's fragment.

### :valid
The `:valid` CSS pseudo-class represents any *`<input>`* or other *`<form>`* element whose contents *validate* successfully. This allows to easily make valid fields adopt an appearance that helps the user confirm that their data is formatted properly.
